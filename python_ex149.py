# The dictionary keys and values in this example are different from
#  older versions of the book. I made the keys an values shorter
# so the example fits on smaller devices. I changed "programming" to "code"
# "charitable" to "Gates" and "america_founded" to "founded".
# If you have an older version of the book, you can email me at cory@theselftaughtprogrammer.io 
# and I will send you the newest version. Thank you so much for purchasing my book!
