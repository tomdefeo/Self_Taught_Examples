# IMPORTANT. I recently changed this example in the book.
# In older versions of the book the example was

# sentence = "    The cat’s craddle.        "
# sentence = sentence.strip()
# sentence

# I made this change so the example fits on smaller devices. If you have an older
# version of the book, you can email me at cory@theselftaughtprogrammer.io 
# and I will send you the newest version. Thank you so much for purchasing my book!

s = "    The        "
s = s.strip()
