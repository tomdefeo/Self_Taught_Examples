# IMPORTANT. I recently changed this example in the book.
# In older versions of the book the example was:

#year_born = "1952"
#"""Walter Isaacson was
#   born in {}
#""".format(year_born)

# I made this change so the example fits on smaller devices. If you have an older
# version of the book, you can email me at cory@theselftaughtprogrammer.ioâ€¨
# and I will send you the newest version. Thank you so much for purchasing my book!
