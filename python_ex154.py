# I changed the variables in this example.
# In older versions of the book, I use the variables list_of_lists, rappers and rockers.  
# I shortened the variables in the new version of the book so the example fits on smaller devices.
# If you have an older version of the book, you can email me at cory@theselftaughtprogrammer.io 
# and I will send you the newest version. Thank you so much for purchasing my book!
