# I changed the variables in this example from
#  eighteens and nineteens in older versions of the book to eights and nines 
# so the example fits on smaller devices. If you have an older
# version of the book, you can email me at cory@theselftaughtprogrammer.io 
# and I will send you the newest version. Thank you so much for purchasing my book!
