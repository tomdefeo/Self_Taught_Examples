# I shortened the message that gets printed in this example.
# The example in older versions of the book prints "I don't know what x is."
# I did this so the example will fit better on smaller devices.
# If you have an older version of the book, you can email
# me at cory@theselftaughtprogrammer.io 
# to update to the newest version. Thank you so much for reading!
