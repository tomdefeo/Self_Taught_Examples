# IMPORTANT. I recently changed this example in the book.
# In older versions of the book the example was

#ivan = """In place of death
#          there was light.
#       """

# I made this change so the example fits on smaller devices. If you have an older
# version of the book, you can email me at cory@theselftaughtprogrammer.ioâ€¨
# and I will send you the newest version. Thank you so much for purchasing my book!
