# IMPORTANT. I recently changed this example in the book.
# In older versions of the book the example was

#equ = """All animals are
#         equal, but some
#         animals are more
#         equal than others.
#      """
#equ = equ.replace("a", "@")
#equ

# I made this change so the example fits on smaller devices. If you have an older
# version of the book, you can email me at cory@theselftaughtprogrammer.ioâ€¨
# and I will send you the newest version. Thank you so much for purchasing my book!


equ = "All animals are equal."
equ = equ.replace("a", "@")
print(equ)
