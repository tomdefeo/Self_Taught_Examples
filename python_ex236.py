# IMPORTANT. I changed many of the variable names in this example
# so the example fits on smaller devices. Old versions of the book have longer
# variable names. If you have an older
# version of the book, you can email me at cory@theselftaughtprogrammer.ioâ€¨
# and I will send you the newest version. Thank you so much for purchasing my book!
