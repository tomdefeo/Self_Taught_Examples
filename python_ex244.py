# I changed this example to print Created. In previous examples it printed
# Orange object created! I did this so the example fits on smaller devices.
# If you have an older version of the book, you can email me at
# cory@theselftaughtprogrammer.ioâ€¨ and I will send you the newest version.
# Thank you so much for purchasing my book!
