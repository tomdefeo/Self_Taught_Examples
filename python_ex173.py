# IMPORTANT. I recently changed this example in the book.
# In older versions of the book the example was:
#  """Walter Isaacson
#   was born
#   in {}.""".format("1952")
# I made this change so the example fits on smaller devices. If you have an older
# version of the book, you can email me at cory@theselftaughtprogrammer.io 
# and I will send you the newest version. Thank you so much for purchasing my book!
